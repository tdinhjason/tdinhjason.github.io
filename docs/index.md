### About me
![headshot](/assets/headshot.png)

My name is Jason Dinh. I'm from Salem, MA and currently reside in Bethlehem, PA. I'm a senior at Lehigh University studying Business Information Systems and Finance w/ a minor in Data Science. I'm currently taking a journalism class called COMM165 -- Data Storytelling. I'll be sharing some updates about my progress on the class on this site.

Outside of school, I love to be outside! Some of my favorite activites are: snowboarding, hiking, camping, longboarding, yoga, lifting weights, and taking pictures!

Here's some of my favorite pictures I've taken so far

This a huge rock near my hometown that I frequent for pictures, sunrises, sunsets, and generally just to get away from the 'burbs lol.

This is BlackJack, aka Blackie, a goat I met on a service trip to Paris, Virginia in 2018. He really bridged the gap between the reigning goats of the farm and us the lowly volunteers.

This is a baby sheep on the farm, too cute not to include.

Ever meet an emu? Imagine an ostrich and shrink it down a bit. That's basically what they look like, super fast and I tried running around with a few of them, needless to say, they beat me.
