### About me
![headshot](/assets/headshot.png)

My name is Jason Dinh, I'm a senior at Lehigh University studying Business Information Systems and Finance w/ a minor in Data Science. I'm currently taking a journalism class called COMM165 -- Data Storytelling. I'll be sharing some updates about my progress on the class on this site.

Outside of school, I love to be outside! Some of my favorite activites are: snowboarding, hiking, camping, longboarding, yoga, lifting weights, and taking pictures!

Here's some of my favorite pictures I've taken so far
